      <description>In Belgium and The Netherlands there is a big stray cat problem. Thousands of cats roam the streets, are dumped in containers or forests, buried alive under the ground or drowned in canals. Litters of unwanted kittens or are thrown in boxes along the highway.

Some kittens, barely a few hours old, were found in plastic bags on a cycle path.</description>
